# To Do List
This is a basic to do list app built using react. A user can currently create a to do and it is then rendered on the page with all of the others that have been created.

Please note that this is spiked as it is a learning exercise in React. I plan to complete this again fully test driven.

This app is a continuation of [to-do-list](https://github.com/Caitlin-cooling/to-do-list), where I got blocked trying so many different things the code base was a mess. I decided that I knew what the issue was (using old versions of Babel causing all sorts of issues) and that it would be easier to cut my losses and start again.

## How to use
1. `git clone https://github.com/Caitlin-cooling/new-to-do-list.git`
2. `cd to-do-list`
3. `npm install` to install dependencies
4. Open `dist/index.html` in the browser.

Once you make a change, please ensure to run `npm run start` to make those changes.
